        <p>Web design refers to the design of websites that are displayed on the internet. It usually<br>
            refers to the user experience aspects of website development rather than software<br>
            development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop<br>
            browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has<br>
            become ever-increasingly important.</p></div>
